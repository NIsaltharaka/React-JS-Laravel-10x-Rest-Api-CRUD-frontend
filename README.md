This project involves the integration of React.js and Laravel 10 to create a full-stack web application. The frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a dynamic and efficient user experience. On the backend, Laravel 10, a PHP web application framework, is employed to handle server-side logic and database interactions.

The application follows a RESTful architecture, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data. Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, facilitates communication between the React.js frontend and the Laravel 10 backend by making asynchronous requests to the RESTful API.

For data storage and retrieval, MySQL, a relational database management system, is utilized. The integration of these technologies ensures a seamless flow of data between the client and server, enabling efficient handling of user interactions and data management in the application.
